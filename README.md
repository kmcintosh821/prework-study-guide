# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project is a succinct, one-page study guide detailing what I learned through the bootcamp's prework course. Its creation utilized the most common, fundamental aspects of coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and using Git to record my progress through it; the study guide content reflects this, listing notes about each part of the coding process as I've learned them. It is open to updating as I see fit, and I fully intend to further develop it as I continue through the bootcamp course.

## Usage

Most of this study guide's functionality is simply reading what is visible on the page. It is divided into clearly distinct sections pertaining to each topic; in the cases of HTML and CSS, there are additional headers that offer examples.

However, there is also an instruction to check the console, using Chrome DevTools (or an equivalent for any other major browser). Once open, it displays the result of the project's JavaScript file. It lists the four topics in order, and then suggests a random topic to focus on. In function, it's more of an easter egg than actual guidance, but it demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of how JavaScript works.
